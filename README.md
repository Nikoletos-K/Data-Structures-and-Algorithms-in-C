# Data-Stuctures-and-Algorithms-in-C
Here you will find some data structures and algorithms implemented in C. These algorithms are mostly based on the book ___Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen___.

## Data structures

| Data structure | Information |
| --- | --- |
| __Bloom filter__ | Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not – in other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set". Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with the counting Bloom filter variant); the more items added, the larger the probability of false positives. |
| __Red-black Tree__ | Red–black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node stores an extra bit representing "color" ("red" or "black"), used to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions. When the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged and "repainted" to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case. The properties are designed such that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently. The re-balancing is not perfect, but guarantees searching in __O(logn)__ time, where n is the number of nodes of the tree. The insertion and deletion operations, along with the tree rearrangement and recoloring, are also performed in __O(logn)__ time. |
| __Linked List__ | Linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. |
| __Queue__ | |
| __Hashtable with lists__ | |
| __Hashtable with Red-black tree__ | |
| __Hashtable with buckets to Red-black tree__ | |
| __MaxHeap__ | |
| __DisJointSet__ | |
